# Basic-Camera-calibration using images

This is a simple example of camera calibration using openCV 4.0. Although the tutorial is provided on openCV.org, I still faced issues in setting up this project. So, it may save someone else's time and effort.

To use this repository follow the below steps:

1) Clone or download this respository
2) Using visual studio 2017, open the solution file 
3) Make sure the command line argument is provided in the properties of the project
4) After building the proj, the images stored in Debug folder will be used for claibration
